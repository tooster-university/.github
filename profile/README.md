## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This organization was created to keep most* of my university projects and repositories in one place, without messing with my public profile. Everything in here should be MIT licensed if not stated otherwise.

Someday in the future I'll organize it in a better way, add TOC's, upload my solutions to labs etc.

##### \*I didn't post my solutions to algorithmic curses, materials from curses about administering linux systems and similar, as the work there was mostly "if it works, it works" or "do on remote machine" or even "explain to others"
